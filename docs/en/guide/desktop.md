# Desktop Client

In addition to the web version, you can also download the latest desktop client from the [GitHub Release](https://github.com/rockbenben/img-prompt/releases/latest), which supports **Windows**, **MacOS**, and **Linux**. Please select the appropriate file for your operating system:

- **Windows**: For Windows systems, choose either the `.exe` or `.msi` file.
- **Mac (Intel version)**: For Macs with Intel processors, choose either the `.dmg` or `.app.tar.gz` file.
- **Mac (Apple Silicon version, e.g. M1/M2)**: For Macs with Apple Silicon (M1/M2), choose the `aarch64.dmg` or `aarch64.app.tar.gz` file.
- **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**: For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, choose the `.deb` file.
- **Linux (Universal version)**: For other Linux distributions, choose either the `.AppImage` or `.rpm` file.

The desktop client is set to **Chinese** by default, but you can easily switch languages via the navigation bar.
