With its clean and intuitive interface, users can easily\nview and combine the prompts they need. Each prompt also comes with translations\nin the user’s native language, allowing you to quickly select or combine\nkeywords with just a click or input, simplifying the prompt creation process and\nboosting your creative efficiency.\n\nExperience IMGPrompt now and boost your creative workflow!\n\n\n\n\nFeatures#\n\n\nSmart Recommendation System#\n\nIMGPrompt offers intelligent recommendations based on the keywords you input\n(supports 14 languages, including Chinese and English). The system automatically\nsuggests related prompts, helping you quickly find the right expression, saving\ntime, and increasing creative efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nTranslation Feature#\n\nThe built-in translation feature allows you to convert prompts in any language\nto English, ensuring compatibility across various AI image generation tools.\nThis is particularly useful in multilingual environments, eliminating language\nbarriers.\n\n\n\n\nRandom Color Generator#\n\nThis feature allows users to quickly replace color-related keywords within\nprompts, introducing variety and fun into the creative process. It sparks\ninspiration and helps users explore diverse creative directions.\n\n\nAdditional Features#\n\n * Prompt Tagging: Prompts can be tagged with keywords separated by commas. The\n   system automatically deduplicates and matches tags, providing native language\n   translations for easier understanding and usage.\n * Interactive Editing: Users can quickly add or remove prompts by clicking on\n   tags, streamlining the editing process.\n * Categorized Tag Display: Selected tags are displayed by category, helping you\n   quickly search and edit prompts.\n * Character Count: IMGPrompt includes a built-in character counter that\n   suggests keeping your prompt length under 380 characters for optimal\n   generation results.\n * Localization: In addition to the translation feature, IMGPrompt operates\n   entirely in your local language without relying on third-party databases or\n   services.\n\nThe translation feature in IMGPrompt uses DeepL and Google Translate APIs.

Words\n   that appear earlier in the prompt have a higher weight.\n * Quantity Control: The number of objects should generally be kept between two\n   and three to avoid overwhelming the model with too much information.\n * Element Emphasis: To emphasize a specific element, use parentheses or\n   exclamation marks. For example, beautiful forest background, desert!!,\n   (((sunset))) will prioritize \"desert\" and \"sunset\" elements. Weighted values\n   inside parentheses (e.g., (masterpiece:1.5)) specify the importance of the\n   details, and multiple parentheses have a similar effect.\n * Fusion Expression: Use square brackets to indicate the blending of different\n   elements. For example, {blue hair:white hair:0.3} represents a combination of\n   blue and white hair, with blue hair having a 0.3 weight.\n * Negative Prompts: Negative prompts effectively help avoid unwanted elements.\n   For example, to generate an image of a mountain without trees, you can use\n   mountain | tree:-10, where tree:-10 significantly reduces the weight of\n   trees.","routePath":"/en/guide/prompt-rule","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""}]
