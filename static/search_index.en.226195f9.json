Words\n   that appear earlier in the prompt have a higher weight.\n * Quantity Control: The number of objects should generally be kept between two\n   and three to avoid overwhelming the model with too much information.\n * Element Emphasis: To emphasize a specific element, use parentheses or\n   exclamation marks. For example, beautiful forest background, desert!!,\n   (((sunset))) will prioritize \"desert\" and \"sunset\" elements. Weighted values\n   inside parentheses (e.g., (masterpiece:1.5)) specify the importance of the\n   details, and multiple parentheses have a similar effect.\n * Fusion Expression: Use square brackets to indicate the blending of different\n   elements. For example, {blue hair:white hair:0.3} represents a combination of\n   blue and white hair, with blue hair having a 0.3 weight.\n * Negative Prompts: Negative prompts effectively help avoid unwanted elements.\n   For example, to generate an image of a mountain without trees, you can use\n   mountain | tree:-10, where tree:-10 significantly reduces the weight of\n   trees.","routePath":"/en/guide/prompt-rule","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","frontmatter":{},"version":""}]
